<div class="jumbotron">
    <p>Knockout is a standalone JavaScript implementation of the Model-View-ViewModel pattern with templates. </p>

    <p>The underlying principles are therefore:</p>

    <p>* a clear separation between domain data, view components and data to be displayed</p>
    <p>* the presence of a clearly defined layer of specialized code to manage the relationships between the view components</p>

    <p>The latter leverages the native event management features of the JavaScript language.</p>

    <p>These features streamline and simplify the specification of complex relationships between view components,</p>
    <p>which in turn make the display more responsive and the user experience richer.</p>

    <p>Knockout was developed and is maintained as an open source project by Steve Sanderson, a Microsoft employee.</p>
    <p>As the author said, "it continues exactly as-is, and will evolve in whatever direction I and its user community wishes to take it", and stressed, "this isn’t a Microsoft product"</p>
